                Hi, I’m Mubin Kadiwala, a driven individual with a passion for
                excellence in everything I do and I am a tennis enthusiats. I
                find people often separate pofessional and personal lives but we
                really on have one life and I strive to carry myself with
                distinction, humility, trust, and respect for myself and others
                in any environment. My goal is to work hard, help others, and
                enjoy the company of family, friends, and colleagues.

                Professionally, I gravitate towards start-up ventures because of
                my passion for offering help across multiple technology and
                business stacks. This holistic approach gives me a comprehensive
                understanding of business models and enhances my effectiveness
                as a technical solutions specialist. My interpersonal skills and
                technical expertise have allowed me to excel in providing
                engaging product demos and evaluation support. With over 10
                years of experience as a software developer, I have become an
                adept problem solver, particularly with API issues, and I excel
                at providing clients with custom integration solutions. But I
                also value the structure and clear command chain found in more
                established, larger companies.

                I apply the same mindset to home improvement projects, like the
                one I completed at the end of 2023, where I installed flooring
                and repainted our living spaces. I meticulously planned the
                project, creating a spreadsheet to track costs, materials, and
                hours spent. While my inexperience led to some overages in
                flooring planks, I managed to save overall on the project. The
                experiences and lessons I gather in this endeavor will help with
                future DIY home improvement projects.

                When I’m not busy at home or at the office, I enjoy spending
                time with my family. We love spending oour Saturday mornings
                treasure hunting at estate sales. I am an avid tennis player and
                would play every day if I could. Although I practiced piano for
                14 years I never learned to play it, at least not like my
                15-year-old son who is a beast on the piano, and I love hearing
                him play (one of) my favorite songs

                  >Top Gun Anthem</a
                >. I save the best part of me for last and that all goes to my
                lovely wife who is the cornerstone of our family. Her incredible
                ability to understand and connect with people on an emotional
                level has made her an exceptional mental health therapist. She
                has been my rock for 19 years, and her support and understanding
                are the best parts of me and everyone I know recognizes this.
