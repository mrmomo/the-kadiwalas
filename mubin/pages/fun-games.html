                Connections is a daily word puzzle featured by the New York
                Times. Players are given a grid of 16 words and must organize
                them into four groups of four words each. The goal is to find a
                relationships that connects the words within each group. These
                groups can be straightforward or difficult at best, making the
                game both challenging and enjoyable. I find that on Monday the
                puzzle is a little easier and gets progressively harder each
                day. It's a great way for player's to improve vocabulary and
                problem-solving skills. I love playing it in the evenings and
                sharing my results with other Connections enthusiasts.

                Wordle is a daily online word puzzle where players have six
                tries to guess a five-letter word. After each guess, the game
                returns color blocks for the letters: green if the letter is in
                the correct position, yellow if the letter is in the word but in
                the wrong position, and gray if the letter is not in the word at
                all. This process of trial and error continues until the player
                either guesses the word correctly or runs out of attempts. A new
                game is available everyday, it's a great way to do a quick
                mental exercise at the start or end of your day.

                Strands is a word search puzzle game offered by the New York
                Times but it is like no other word search puzzle! I was
                initially against playing word search games but this one got me
                hooked. The player aims to find words given by a subject hint.
                The challenge lies in forming words multiple directions.
                Surprisingly, this game offers clues to help you get started but
                I find it more rewarding to solve without any hints if possible.
                Strands combines the joy of discovery with the satisfaction of
                mastering word formation.

                Hashtag is a word puzzle game by the New York Times that
                challenges players to find words hidden within a grid of letters
                shaped like a hashtag (#). So far, of all the NYT games
                meentioned here, I find this one to be the easiest but still
                very challenging. The goal is to arrange the randomly placed
                letters into words. If you have a correct postion the letter
                block turns green, if the letter is in the correct row but wrong
                position it is represented by a yellow block color and all other
                letter blocks are grey. This daily puzzl offers a mix of
                straightforward and tricky words to find.
